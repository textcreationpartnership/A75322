            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the Late Dreadful Earth-Quake In the ISLAND of MEVIS, <hi>St.</hi> CHRISTOPHERS, &amp;c. Which happen'd in the Beginning of <hi>April,</hi> of this preſent Year 1690. In a LETTER to a Friend in <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Intereſt which you have in the Trade of this Iſland, obliges me to give you ſome Account of the Earth-Quake that happened in this Place. It was very aſtoniſhing and terrible while it laſted; but as for what Miſchief it has done, we cannot for the preſent give a juſt Account of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt leave it imperfect till the next. However, you may be ſure it was very great, by the waſtful Deſtruction of Buildings, which it has made: And it was one of our chiefeſt Happineſſes that the Fort and Magazine eſcap'd.</p>
            <p>It began upon the ſixth of <hi>April,</hi> about five of the Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. At what time we heard a rumbling Noiſe, like that of diſtant Thunder, which ſeem'd to come from the Bowels of the great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſeated in the very Navil of the Iſland. We heard it for a ſhort while with great Amazement; for it laſted not long before we felt the dire Effects of thoſe violent Vapors ſtrugling and contending in the Womb of the Earth for paſſage forth. So ſtrong was the Motion, that within ſome few Moments after the Noiſe began, enſu'd a moſt amazing Earth-Quake, which ſhook the whole Iſland to that degree, that all the Houſes in <hi>Charles</hi> Town that were built of Brick or Stone, dropt of a ſudden down from the Top to the Bottom in perfect Ruines. Thoſe that were built of Wood were no leſs violently ſhaken, but ſtood however; which ſhew'd that the Rivetings of woodden Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are far ſtronger, and not ſo eaſily disjoynted as the Co-agmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Cement and Mortar. Nevertheleſs, it was a dreadful thing to ſee Men, Women and Children flying up and down from Place to Place in Fear and Conſternation, yet not knowing where to fly for Safety, while the Surface of the tottering Earth hardly gave them Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, no leſs in an Agony than the Earth it ſelf, to ſet their Feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground: which in many places alſo open'd, and from the yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clefts, vomited up a ſort of hot, bituminous Water, whole Tuns full at a time, no leſs offenſive to the Smell, than dreadful to the Sight: and ſuch was the Force which thruſt up that heavy Element, as to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135594:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 33 -->
mount it a great height in the Air. The Sea it ſelf for a time forſook the Shoar for about three quarters of a Mile together, and left a great Number of Fiſh of a large Size to lye gaping upon the Sand, till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd again: which violent Motion of the Water happen'd diverſe times, though not with the ſame Rapidneſs and Fury, nor at ſo great a Diſtance as at firſt.</p>
            <p>Another thing was obſervable, that whereas it is an uſual thing in this Iſland, for every Houſe to have a large Ciſtern, nine or ten Foot deep, and fifteen or twenty Foot in Diameter, for the Conveniency of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Rain-water, the Violence of the Earth-quake all over the Iſland was ſuch, that thoſe Ciſterns threw up the Water eight or ten foot high in the Air, as if it had been ſpouted out of ſo many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Springs. The Earth alſo in many places was thrown up in vaſt Heaps; and great Numbers of large Trees were torn up by the Roots, and buried in the Rents and Gapings of the Iſland, and never expected to be ſeen more. I wiſh we may have a true Sence of this terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon us.</p>
            <p>Nor has this Iſland only felt the ſevere Strokes of Celeſtial Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as we are told by ſeveral Perſons, ſince come from thence to this Iſland, St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> has had a large Share of the ſame Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; where a late Earth-quake, no leſs dreadful, has made the ſame Ravages, by throwing down and burying whole Houſes in the wide Fiſſures of the gaping Mold, overturning their Sugar-Mills, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Colledge, together with ſeveral other Piles of Brick and Stone, to the great Amazement of all that beheld it, and no leſs Damage of them that ſuffer'd. We are alſo inform'd that <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> and <hi>Monſerrat</hi> have likewiſe been very greatly ſhaken, though not in ſo ſevere a manner; and that the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> alſo has had ſome trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Fits, but not ſo conſiderable. As for our parts, we are not quite rid of all our Fears, for this Iſland has had ſeveral ſhort Agonies ſince, that have not long endur'd, which is all we have to make us hope that the Fury of the Cauſe is over, and that the Effects will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ceaſe.</p>
            <p>After we had ſomewhat recover'd our ſelves, I began to conſider what might be the Cauſe of this dreadful Accident: and by my little Reading, I find the great Philoſophers cannot agree concerning the true Cauſe of Earth-quakes. For ſome will have Wind, ſome Water to be the Cauſe of them, when put up within the Bowels of the Earth, like ſtrong Liquor fermenting in a Bottle, and not able to get forth, otherwiſe, than break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glaſs. For my Part, I believe both Wind and Water concur'd in this which we have ſuffer'd. But I ſhall not trouble you with my Philoſophy, you being in a Place where you may have recourſe to the more Learned, for better Satisfaction than I can pretend to give you. This is certain, we have ſeverely felt the fatal Conſequences of theſe Contentions within the Bowels of the Earth; and this being over, I hope I ſhall have no more occaſion to trouble you with theſe ſad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
